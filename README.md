# Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow
Jupyter Notebook created alongside course study for Neural Network Regression using TensorFlow

## What it covers:
* Modeling a Regression Model within TensorFlow
  * Define input/output shapes
  * Create model
  * Evaluate model
  * Visualize the data
  * Visualize model's predictions
  * Run experiments to improve model
* Compare results of the experiments
  * Track experiment results
  * Save models
  * Loading saved model
  * Downloading model/files from Google Colab
* Preprocessing Data (Normalization/Standardization) to improve results
